The origins of music like of anything eternal and saint are not exactly defined as it spreads all around the lands of the world. Like religion it searches the areas of every tiny corner of our planet touching the hearts, strengthening the feelings, bursting emotions. It is easily spread by the people travelling around the countries who bring their music to a new undiscovered areas, just as they bring with them their own faith or rituals.

The popularity of such a famous phenomenon like music proves its importance to people. Same relates to me: music has always meant a lot for me. It appeared in my life from the day I was born when I listened to motherâ€™s lullaby; then during the school I visited piano classes and discovered the classical tenors as well as I found out about different modern genres of music; and now I am aware of most developing and ever existing kinds of music when being more or less defined in my preferences. My favour in music now falls to hip-hop and I would like to discuss this kind of music further in my paper.
